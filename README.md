# My idlers

A self-hosted web app for displaying, organizing and storing information about your servers (VPS/Dedi), shared & reseller hosting, seedboxes,
domains, DNS and misc services.

Despite what the name infers this self-hosted web app isn't just for storing idling server information. By using
a [YABS](https://github.com/masonr/yet-another-bench-script) output you can get disk & network speed values along with
GeekBench 5 & 6 scores to do easier comparing and sorting. Of course storing other services e.g. web hosting is possible and supported too with My idlers.

## Adding a YABS benchmark

yabs.sh now has JSON formatted response and can POST the output directly from calling the script.

With My idlers you can use your API key and the server id to directly POST the benchmark result

`https://yourdomain.com/api/yabs/SERVERID/USERAPIKEYISHERE`

Example yabs.sh call to POST the result:

`curl -sL yabs.sh | bash -s -- -s "https://yourdomain.com/api/yabs/SERVERID/USERAPIKEYISHERE"`

## TODO


## API endpoints

For GET requests the header must have `Accept: application/json` and your API token (found at `/account`)

`Authorization : Bearer API_TOKEN_HERE`

All API requests must be appended with `api/` e.g `mydomain.com/api/servers/gYk8J0a7`

## Notes

**Public viewable listings**

If enabled the public viewable table for your server listings is at `/servers/public`
You can configure what you want viewable at ```/settings```

**Due date / due soon**

This is simply just a reminder. If the homepage is requested (viewed) when a service is over due date it will get reset
to plus the term from the old due date.

E.g if the term is a month then the due date gets updated to be 1 month from the old due date.

**Supporting YABS commands:**

```curl -sL yabs.sh | bash```

or

```curl -sL yabs.sh | bash -s -- -r```
